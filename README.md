# Remote File Editor
Remote file editor allows editing ASCII text files remotely on a host using a web interface with syntax highlighting.

## How to use it?
First install all the bower components by running:
> $ bower install

If you do not want to use bower, you can also unzip bower_components.zip to
provide all the components files.

Then just run the server on your fhost using:
> $ ./startme.sh
fgdsgfhhh
Running it requires the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) module.

Now you can browse to host:8999 (you can config this using --port) to see files under the running directory. You can click on the "open in code editor" link to edit a file. The changes you make will automatically (and *ALWAYS*) be saved on the host after a short delay for your every change.

Put the files you want to allow remote modification under the `links` directory:
> $ ln -s <your_project_directory> links/

## URL APIs
The following URL paths/parameters are supported:

* /_path_: This displays the content of a file or a directory with the given (relative) path.

* /edit?file=*path*: This opens an editor for the file with syntax highlighting.
  * You can use the "fontsize" parameter to set the editor font size. For example "&fontsize=16" sets editor font size to 16px.
  * You can use the "mode" parameter to set the syntax highlight mode. For example "&mode=javascript" forces the editor to treat the file as a javascript file. By default the editor guesses the mode from the file extension.

* /delete?file=*path*: This removes a file or an empty directory.

* /mkdir?file=*path*: This creates a directory (equivalent to "mkdir -p").

## More highlights
* A check in file path is implemented: only files whose path are under the project directory (link not expanded) are accessible.
* Supports editing Markdown files, in which case a live rendering is shown to the right.

## Currently known issues
* Only ASCII text files are supported; opening images etc. will result in errors.
* Editing the same file from multiple clients is NOT supported --- whoever saves later wins.
